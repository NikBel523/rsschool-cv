Started my career as an economist in a large group of medical equipment factories, I realised, that I am in need of any careere changes.
So I started to engage my self with a different fields of studies. After a while I opted for a front end development career with a hopes to became a full stack developer someday.

### Code Example from Code Wars

Small task from one of a courses I participated. The goal is to calculate average scores for to teams and decide the winner.

```
const calcAverage = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3;

const avgDolphins = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
const avgKoalas = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);

function checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {
    if (avgDolphins / avgKoalas >= 2) {
        console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
    } else if (avgKoalas / avgDolphins >= 2) {
        console.log(`Koalas win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
    } else {
        console.log(`Scores are (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas}). Nobody wins`)
